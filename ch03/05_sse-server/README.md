# SSE Server

SSE (Server Sent Events) is a standard for server-to-client streaming, allowing servers to push real-time updates to clients over HTTP. This is particularly useful for applications that require live updates, such as chat applications, notifications, or real-time data feeds. Also, your server can be used by multiple clients at the same time as it lives on a server that can be run somewhere in the cloud for example.

## Overview

This lesson covers how to build and consume SSE Servers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Build an SSE Server.
- Debug an SSE Server using the Inspector.
- Consume an SSE Server using Visual Studio Code.


## SSE, how it works

SSE is one of two supported transport types. You've already seen the first one stdio being used in previous lessons. The difference is the following:

- SSE needs you to handle two things; connection and messages.
- As this is a server that can live anywhere, you need that to reflect in how you work with tools like the Inspector and Visual Studio Code. What that means is that instead of pointing out how to start the server, you instead point to the endpoint where it can establish a connection. See below example code:


    <details>
    <summary>TypeScript</summary>

    ```typescript
    app.get("/sse", async (_: Request, res: Response) => {
        const transport = new SSEServerTransport('/messages', res);
        transports[transport.sessionId] = transport;
        res.on("close", () => {
            delete transports[transport.sessionId];
        });
        await server.connect(transport);
    });

    app.post("/messages", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
        const sessionId = req.query.sessionId as string;
        const transport = transports[sessionId];
        if (transport) {
            await transport.handlePostMessage(req, res);
        } else {
            res.status(400).send('No transport found for sessionId');
        }
    });
    ```

    In the preceding code:

    - `/sse` is set up as a route. When a request is made towards this route, a new transport instance is created and the server *connects* using this transport
    - `/messages`, this is the route that handles incoming messages.

    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Python</summary>

    ```python
    mcp = FastMCP("My App")

    @mcp.tool()
    def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        """Add two numbers"""
        return a + b

    # Mount the SSE server to the existing ASGI server
    app = Starlette(
        routes=[
            Mount('/', app=mcp.sse_app()),
        ]
    )

    ```

    In the preceding code we:

    - Create an instance of an ASGI server (using Starletter specifically) and mount the default route `/`

      What happens behind the scenes is that the routes `/sse` and `/messages` are setup to handle connections and messages respectively. The rest of the app, like adding features like tools, happens like with stdio servers.

    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>.NET</summary>

    ```csharp
    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
    builder.Services
        .AddMcpServer()
        .WithTools<Tools>();


    builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

    var app = builder.Build();

    app.MapMcp();
    ```

    There are two methods that helps us go from a web server to a web server supporting SSE and that is:

    - `AddMcpServer`, this method adds capabilities.
    - `MapMcp`, this adds routes like `/SSE` and `/messages`.


    </details>

Now that we know a little bit more about SSE, let's build an SSE server next.

## Exercise: Creating an SSE Server

To create our server, we need to keep two things in mind:

- We need to use a web server to expose endpoints for connection and messages.
- Build our server like we normally do with tools, resources and prompts when we were using stdio.

### -1- Create a server instance

To create our server, we use the same types as with stdio. However, for the transport, we need to choose SSE.

<details>
<summary>Typescript</summary>

```typescript
import { Request, Response } from "express";
import express from "express";
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { SSEServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse.js";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "example-server",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

const app = express();

const transports: {[sessionId: string]: SSEServerTransport} = {};
```

In the preceding code we've:

- Created a server instance.
- Defined an app using the web framework express.
- Created a transports variable that we will use to store incoming connections.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Python</summary>

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount, Host
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP


mcp = FastMCP("My App")
```

In the preceding code we've:

- Imported the libraries we're going to need with Starlette (an ASGI framework) being pulled in.
- Created an MCP server instance `mcp`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>.NET</summary>

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services
    .AddMcpServer();


builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

var app = builder.Build();

// TODO: add routes 
```

At this point, we've:

- Created a web app
- Added support for MCP features through `AddMcpServer`.

</details>

Let's add the needed routes next.

### -2- Add routes

Let's add routes next that handle the connection and incoming messages:

<details>
<summary>Typescript</summary>

```typescript
app.get("/sse", async (_: Request, res: Response) => {
  const transport = new SSEServerTransport('/messages', res);
  transports[transport.sessionId] = transport;
  res.on("close", () => {
    delete transports[transport.sessionId];
  });
  await server.connect(transport);
});

app.post("/messages", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const sessionId = req.query.sessionId as string;
  const transport = transports[sessionId];
  if (transport) {
    await transport.handlePostMessage(req, res);
  } else {
    res.status(400).send('No transport found for sessionId');
  }
});

app.listen(3001);
```

In the preceding code we've defined:

- An `/sse` route that instantiates a transport of type SSE and ends up calling `connect` on the MCP server.
- A `/messages` route that takes care of incoming messages.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Python</summary>

```python
app = Starlette(
    routes=[
        Mount('/', app=mcp.sse_app()),
    ]
)
```

In the preceding code we've:

- Created an ASGI app instance using the Starlette framework. As part of that we passes `mcp.sse_app()` to it's list of routes. That ends up mounting an `/sse` and `/messages` route on the app instance.

</details>

<details>
<summary>.NET</summary>

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services
    .AddMcpServer();

builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapMcp();
```

We've added one line of code at the end `add.MapMcp()` this means we now have routes `/SSE` and `/messages`. 

</details>


Let's add capabilties to the server next.

### -3- Adding server capabilities

Now that we've got everything SSE specific defined, let's add server capabilities like tools, prompts and resources.

<details>
<summary>Typescript</summary>

```typescript
server.tool("random-joke", "A joke returned by the chuck norris api", {},
  async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random");
    const data = await response.json();

    return {
      content: [
        {
          type: "text",
          text: data.value
        }
      ]
    };
  }
);
```

Here's how you can add a tool for example. This specific tool creates a tool call "random-joke" that calls a Chuck Norris API and returns a JSON response.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Python</summary>

```python
@mcp.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b
```

Now your server has one tool.

</details>

Your full code should look like so:

<details>
<summary>Typescript</summary>

```typescript
// server-sse.ts
import { Request, Response } from "express";
import express from "express";
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { SSEServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse.js";

// Create an MCP server
const server = new McpServer({
  name: "example-server",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

const app = express();

const transports: { [sessionId: string]: SSEServerTransport } = {};

app.get("/sse", async (_: Request, res: Response) => {
  const transport = new SSEServerTransport("/messages", res);
  transports[transport.sessionId] = transport;
  res.on("close", () => {
    delete transports[transport.sessionId];
  });
  await server.connect(transport);
});

app.post("/messages", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const sessionId = req.query.sessionId as string;
  const transport = transports[sessionId];
  if (transport) {
    await transport.handlePostMessage(req, res);
  } else {
    res.status(400).send("No transport found for sessionId");
  }
});

server.tool("random-joke", "A joke returned by the chuck norris api", {}, async () => {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random");
  const data = await response.json();

  return {
    content: [
      {
        type: "text",
        text: data.value,
      },
    ],
  };
});

app.listen(3001);
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Python</summary>

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount, Host
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP


mcp = FastMCP("My App")

@mcp.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b

# Mount the SSE server to the existing ASGI server
app = Starlette(
    routes=[
        Mount('/', app=mcp.sse_app()),
    ]
)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>.NET</summary>

1. Let's create some tools first, for this we will create a file *Tools.cs* with the following content:

  ```csharp
  using System.ComponentModel;
  using System.Text.Json;
  using ModelContextProtocol.Server;

  namespace server;

  [McpServerToolType]
  public sealed class Tools
  {

      public Tools()
      {
      
      }

      [McpServerTool, Description("Add two numbers together.")]
      public async Task<string> AddNumbers(
          [Description("The first number")] int a,
          [Description("The second number")] int b)
      {
          return (a + b).ToString();
      }

  }
  ```

  Here we've added the following:

  - Created a class `Tools` with the decorator `McpServerToolType`.
  - Defined a tool `AddNumbers` by decorating the method with `McpServerTool`. We've also provided parameters and an implementation.

1. Let's leverage the `Tools` class we just created:

  ```csharp
  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
  builder.Services
      .AddMcpServer()
      .WithTools<Tools>();


  builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

  var app = builder.Build();

  app.MapMcp();
  ```

  We've added a call to `WithTools` that specifies `Tools` as the class containing the tools. That's it, we're ready.

Great, we have a server using SSE, let's take it for a spin next.

## Exercise: Debugging an SSE Server with Inspector

Inspector is a great tool that we saw in a previous lesson [Creating your first server](/03-GettingStarted/01-first-server/README.md). Let's see if we can use the Inspector even here:

### -1- Running the inspector

To run the inspector, you first must have an SSE server running, so let's do that next:

1. Run the server 

    <details>
    <summary>Typescript</summary>

    ```sh
    tsx && node ./build/server-sse.ts
    ```

    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Python</summary>

    ```sh
    uvicorn server:app
    ```

    Note how we use the executable `uvicorn` that's installed when we typed `pip install "mcp[cli]"`. Typing `server:app` means we're trying to run a file `server.py` and for it to have a Starlette instance called `app`. 
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>.NET</summary>

    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

    This should start the server. To interface with it you need a new terminal.

    </details>

1. Run the inspector

    > ![NOTE]
    > Run this in a separate terminal window than the server is running in. Also note, you need to adjust the below command to fit the URL where your server runs.

    ```sh
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli http://localhost:8000/sse --method tools/list
    ```

    Running the inspector looks the same in all runtimes. Note how we instead of passing a path to our server and a command for starting the server we instead pass the URL where the server is running and we also specify the `/sse` route.

### -2- Trying out the tool

Connect the server by selecting SSE in the droplist and fill in the url field where your server is running, for example http:localhost:4321/sse. Now click the "Connect" button. As before, select to list tools, select a tool and provide input values. You should see a result like below:

![SSE Server running in inspector](./assets/sse-inspector.png)

Great, you're able to work with the inspector, let's see how we can work with Visual Studio Code next.

## Assignment

Try building out your server with more capabilities. See [this page](https://api.chucknorris.io/) to, for example, add a tool that calls an API. You decide what the server should look like. Have fun :)

## Solution

[Solution](./solution/README.md) Here's a possible solution with working code.

## Key Takeaways

The key takeaways from this chapter are the following:

- SSE is the second supported transport next to stdio.
- To support SSE, you need to manage incoming connections and messages using a web framework.
- You can use both Inspector and Visual Studio Code to consume an SSE server, just like stdio servers. Note how it differs a little between stdio and SSE. For SSE, you need to start up the server separately and then run your inspector tool. For the inspector tool, there's also some differences in that you need to specify the URL.
